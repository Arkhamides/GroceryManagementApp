App Overview:

"Its an Inventory application where you can add an item from your grocery list and see what you have and see the ongoing and outgoing transactions"


SETUP:

go to : ..\grocerymanagement1\MyApplication.java and set the serverIP. 
In my case, I turned my computer into a server using XAMPP, went to the command promp, ran "ipconfig" and set up using the IPv4 Address.
Finally, you need the server side code, using PHP. 
I have It all on https://github.com/Arkhamides/GroceryManagementApp_PHP.
In my case, I have put them on C:\xampp\htdocs\GroceryManagementApp. 
If you want to rename your folder and/or change directories, you need to rename the directory invokation inside the java files, where I call out the php scripts.
